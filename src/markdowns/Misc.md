# Miscellaneous

Some quick list of set of tools, that I use on daily bases:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

`API` development platform. It offers a lot, to test, document, and stage differnet requsts to your `API`. It's essential in my daily life.

- [MongoDB Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass)

Privdes a `GUI` to the `mongoDB` instances, if needed. Comes handy, when you monitor changes, or other lower lever requirments, that doesnt need the `CLI`.

- [React DevTools](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-devtools)

`React DevTools` is a browser extension developed inhouse by facebook. It provides profiling capabilities, and different debug possibiities.
