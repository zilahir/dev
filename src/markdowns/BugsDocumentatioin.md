# Bugs

> It's not a bug, it's a feature.

All jokes aside, every application has bugs. As of that, every team should have a methodology they are using when dealing with bugs, from the moment they are found, identigied, and until the moment they are eventually solved, tested, and the patch is released.

There are some suggested ways in `Scrum` and `Agile` methodologies, that describes what to do with the bugs. I do prefer work in `Scrum` (only if the project allows that), so here I am descrigint those that helped evolve the bug handling processes in the teams I am currently working, or had been working in the past.

## Type of bugs in Scrum

High priority bug — in this category, we consider the bugs that the core functionalities of the product. For example, for a car software product, an issue that doesn’t allow the user to drive its car will be a high priority bug.

Medium priority bug — there is a workaround available. For example, I am opening a car with the key instead of pressing the open button of the key. Unlocking the vehicle is a core function of the car, but since there is a workaround available, the bug will be a medium priority.

Low priority bug — the issue is rather cosmetic or comfort, with no critical functionality.

Defining the classification of the bugs helps for the fast sorting of the defects. The product owner can decide quickly which ones get on the teams’ sprint and which bugs to add to the product backlog.

## High Prio & Blockers

Only when the entire circle is closed, we can know if the functionality meets the business requirements or not. If the full testing is not part of the user story, then we have a fake velocity. We measure the coding, but not if it did the final customer can use it. For the whole Agile methodology to work, testing must be part of the development of the user story and the velocity.
