# IDE

My `IDE` for a long a long time is [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).

I am using Sarah Dasner's [night owl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme). When it comes to ligatures, my chosen fotn is [FireCode](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode). It looks lovely together with the `NightOwl` theme.
